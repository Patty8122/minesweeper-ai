# Minesweeper AI

---

### Summary

This project implements a **Minesweeper game** with an **AI agent** capable of playing the game intelligently. The project is built using Python and the `pygame` library for the graphical interface. Below is a breakdown of the key components and functionality:

---

### 1. **Game Overview**

- **Minesweeper Rules**:
    - The player reveals cells on a grid.
    - Cells may contain mines or numbers indicating the number of neighboring mines.
    - The goal is to mark all mines correctly without triggering any.
- **Grid Setup**:
    - Default grid size: 8x8 with 8 mines.
    - Mines are placed randomly, and the board is initialized with no prior knowledge of mine locations.

---

### 2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

- Built using `pygame`, the interface allows players to:
    - Reveal cells (left-click).
    - Flag cells as mines (right-click).
    - View game instructions and reset the game.
- Visual elements include:
    - A grid with cells that display numbers, flags, or mines.
    - Buttons for AI moves and resetting the game.

---

### 3. **Core Classes**

#### a. **Minesweeper Class**

- Represents the game logic:
    - Initializes the board with random mine placement.
    - Tracks revealed cells, flagged cells, and mines found.
    - Provides methods like `is_mine(cell)` to check if a cell contains a mine and `nearby_mines(cell)` to count neighboring mines.


#### b. **Sentence Class**

- Represents logical statements about the game:
    - Each sentence consists of a set of cells and a count of how many are mines.
    - Supports inference by identifying known safe cells (`known_safes`) or known mines (`known_mines`).


#### c. **MinesweeperAI Class**

- Implements an AI agent to play Minesweeper intelligently:
    - Tracks moves made, known safe cells, and known mines.
    - Maintains a knowledge base of logical sentences derived from revealed cells.
    - Updates knowledge when new information is available using methods like `add_knowledge(cell, count)`.
    - Makes decisions using three strategies:

1. **Safe Move**: Selects a cell known to be safe.
2. **Mine Move**: Flags a cell as a mine if certain.
3. **Random Move**: Selects a random unexplored cell if no safe or mine moves are available.

---

### 4. **AI Logic and Knowledge Base**

The AI uses logical reasoning to deduce safe moves or mine locations:

1. When a cell is revealed, it adds a new sentence to its knowledge base based on neighboring cells and mine counts.
2. It infers new information by combining sentences (e.g., identifying subsets where all remaining cells must be safe or mines).
3. It updates its knowledge base dynamically as more information becomes available.

---

### 5. **Game Flow**

- The game starts with instructions displayed on the screen.
- Players can manually play or let the AI make moves by clicking the "AI Move" button.
- The game ends when:
    - All mines are flagged correctly (win).
    - A mine is revealed (loss).

---

### Key Features

1. **Human-Playable GUI**: Intuitive interface for manual play.
2. **AI Integration**: The AI can autonomously play using logical deductions and probability-based decisions.
3. **Reset Functionality**: Allows restarting the game at any time.

---

### Potential Improvements

- Add difficulty levels with larger grids and more mines.
- Enhance AI logic to incorporate advanced probabilistic reasoning for better decision-making in ambiguous situations.
- Improve GUI aesthetics for better user experience.

This project demonstrates a robust implementation of Minesweeper with an intelligent AI agent capable of reasoning through logical constraints, making it both an engaging game and an educational tool for understanding artificial intelligence concepts!
